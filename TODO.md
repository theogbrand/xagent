1. scrape HN, Emergent Mind, Reddit LocalLlama for new research paper releases
  * can include Arxiv API but seems to have a lag
  * add layers to filtering relevant content by correlating sources
2. Use LLM to read intro and conclusion, ask specific qns to get VERY GOOD and sufficiently detailed gist
  * what is the gist of the most significant discoveries of this paper, based on the background provided and how it impacts the industry 
  * re-read articles on how to read research papers to quickly get the gist of it and see if worth exploring to get business logic
3. use LLM to judge if gist could be relevant to raise to human, and the implications (how and why this paper is relevant + valuable + beneficial to me)
  * "could this help me improve my AI agent project?"
